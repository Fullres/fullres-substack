Instructions for integrating fullres with your Substack publication:

1. Setup custom domain on Substack. You will need to be using a custom domain for your Substack publication (e.g. my-special-site.com). You can do this within Substack by going to Settings > Domain.

2. Setup a Cloudflare Worker. You also need to be using Cloudflare for your domains DNS, as this technique requires a DNS proxy. Sample script is included here `cloudflare-worker-script.js`
